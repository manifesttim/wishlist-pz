               <p>Translations of Monero to Greek & Korean. 
Please note that I've already 
completed  the 1st month of translations and I'd like to ask at least for 
a reimbursement. See below:</p>

<p>If you'd like me to continue, please donate to the 2nd address as well.</p>
<p>I spend between 7 and 8 hours on translations daily.</p>
